# Project 1: British Airways Data Analytics Internship Project
This project was part of my virtual internship with Forage for British Airways. I worked on analyzing customer feedback to find ways to improve the airlineâ€™s services and overall customer experience.
## Task 1 : Web Scraping to gain company insights
* ## Collected Data: Scraped customer reviews from Skytrax using Python and BeautifulSoup.
* ## Cleaned the Data: Processed and cleaned the data to make sure it was ready for analysis (handled missing info, standardized formats, etc.).
* ## Analyzed Sentiment: Used sentiment analysis to figure out what customers were happy or unhappy about.
* ## Visualized Trends: Created clear charts and graphs to highlight key trends in customer feedback.
* ## Suggested Improvements: Based on the analysis, I offered some recommendations on how British Airways could improve their service.
