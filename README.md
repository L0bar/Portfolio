# Project 1: British Airways Data Analytics Internship Project
This project was part of my virtual internship with Forage for British Airways. I worked on analyzing customer feedback to find ways to improve the airlineâ€™s services and overall customer experience.
## Task 1 : Web Scraping to gain company insights
* **Collected Data**: Scraped customer reviews from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/) using Python and BeautifulSoup.
* **Cleaned the Data**: Processed and cleaned the data to make sure it was ready for analysis (handled missing info, standardized formats, etc.).
* **Analyzed Sentiment**: Used sentiment analysis to figure out what customers were happy or unhappy about.
* **Visualized Trends**: Created clear charts and graphs to highlight key trends in customer feedback.
* **Suggested Improvements**: Based on the analysis, I offered some recommendations on how British Airways could improve their service.

From the wordcloud above, we can see the key of topics in customer review are flight, seat , service and time. showing that people are actively talking about their experience on the plane and the staff.

## Tools I Used
* *Python:* For everything from scraping to analysis.
* *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup (for data collection and cleaning), Matplotlib, Seaborn (for creating visualizations).
* *Notebook:* Jupyter Notebook for organizing and running the code.
## Task 2: Predictive Modeling for Customer Acquisition
* **Data Collection:** Collected customer demographic and booking data.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Built models to forecast customer bookings using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
* **Insights**: Identified customer segments likely to book flights and provided targeted marketing recommendations.
 
## Tools Used:
* *Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)*
* *Machine Learning algorithms* 
* *Jupyter Notebook* for implementation
